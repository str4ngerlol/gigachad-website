  <h1 style="color: black; text-align: center;"> what is masculinity? how can you develop masculinity ?</h1> 
<h2>what is masculinity?</h2>
<p> well,the over all meaning of being a <u style="color:rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.719) ;">masculine</u> is being a straight and usefull man. now you might say to yourself, what does that mean ? how can I become a masculine ? so, if you want to find the answer, follow me untill the end.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: left;  color: rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.63);">1. build yourself as a man </h2>
<p>every human has some problems in his life,it may be like <u style="color:rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.521) ;">addiction</u> to something, <u style="color:rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.521) ;"> overusing</u> something or...
  and when you accept those porblems, you will able to fight with them,try to destroy your <font style="color:rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.521) ;">fears</font>.
  fix problems that you have and be confidence about what you are doing.
</p>
<h2>2. find your favors</h2>
<p>search and look for what you like,it can be about your job,your favorite sport,your type of girls and of even about color and everything else. follow thigs that you are intrested in and dont be afraid of saying what you are keen on . 
  <h2>3. control your emotions</h2> 
  <p>as a strong man you must be able to have control on your emotions and feelings. my suggestion is :</p>
  <ol>
    1. dont care about what they say about you,you are creating your way and your own story <p></p>
    2. anything that happens in your life isnt about happiness, those might be unfortunate too. and after a while you will be ok. try and deal with it sooner. <p></p>
  3. God forbid, if someone passed away, undrestand that you can live with them too and you can be a sad winner or a sad loser, your choice. <p></p>
  4. in relationships, control your feelings at dont act too much soon.
  </ol>
  <h2>4. reject weakness,embrace the grind</h2> 
  <p>reject distraction,reject pornography,reject staying weak,embrace nofap. focus on your own way and make YOUR career. </p>
</p>
<h2>5. dont chase girls all the time </h2>
<p>im not saying 'dont talk to girls' but do not look for a relationship with every girl.you can go and talk with a girl that you found attractive and thats not bad thats good either! but not every girl you see and always remember, dont lose yourself in realationsips dont change yourself (live like how you was when you met her)</p>
<h2>6. dont forget about working out and exercises !</h2>
<p>working out and especially going to the gym, is the thing that must man do.trust me there are so many points in going to gym! <p style="color:red ;">1. confidence. 2.aesthetics. 3.strength.</p></p>
<h2>7. dont waste your time doing useless things</h2>
<p>playing video games and spending so much time in social merdia are examples.these are not gonna get you anywhere and dont get addicted to them. life is not a game and if it is,its like minecraft without cheats,they spawn you somewhere (you born irl) you have to look and find what you need (building yourself irl)</p>
<h2>8. build a Future</h2>
<p>find a job and make your career,search so much about it because you might work that job for your whole life and make sure you like that job ! find a profession that you like to do. you have no limits. every logical things are posible to do. just go for it!</p>
<h2>9. always be in grind</h2>
<p>always make sure you are making progresses in your work and etc. always try to be your best version and focus on what you are doing.
</p>
<h2>10. respect your parents</h2>
<p>maybe you are laughing when you see this and say: what a dumb thing to say!
  but if you legit look at what sacrifices they are doing for you,what important things they are doing for you and how important you are for them,you will never forget about them . learn the love from them !
  <hr>
  <p> alright guys hope you accepted all of these things that i said,and dont forget,be around the peaple that deserve you and work on your mental health to stay focus and having a mind control easier! stay hydrated. 
    this site will update soon! </p> <hr>
